          "The Shilpa Education Institute Management System was created to replace the manual system previously used by the institute located in Mahiyanganaya. As undergraduate students in Information Technology, a group proposed to develop a fully automated system to address issues of detail misplacement. After discussing requirements with the institute owner, Mr. V.P.A Vidanapathirana, the group decided to develop a web application connected to a database management system. They identified and developed eight interconnected subsystems including Student, Teacher, and Employee Management, Time Scheduling, Classroom Management, Finance, Examination, Attendance, and Notification Management Systems. The group regularly updated the client with prototypes, accommodating changes according to requirements. The system was completed within the agreed timeline and passed all test cases, providing the institute with a successful and error-free automated management solution.",
